code must get changed, 
i came with an other approiche to make the program dynamic with number of digits,
by making each digit as an array (the schmatic is in picture)

-Problem i ll face-
. Complication to assign an array to a pointer
. Let the code declare n of array relatively with n digits
    :: m thinking about making a for loop that declare N arrays
